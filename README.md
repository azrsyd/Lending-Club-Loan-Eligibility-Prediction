# Lending-Club-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **loan default risk** using historical loan data from Lending Club.  
The goal is to build a **machine learning model** that can assist financial institutions in making **data-driven lending decisions**, reducing default rates while maintaining profitability.

This project demonstrates end-to-end skills in:
- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Machine learning modeling
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Lending platforms face significant financial risk when approving loans to borrowers who may default.  
Traditional rule-based credit assessment methods often fail to capture complex patterns in borrower behavior.

**Objective:**  
Predict whether a borrower will **fully repay** or **default** on a loan using historical lending data.

## 🧠 Approach & Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding
- Dataset: Lending Club historical loan data
- Target variable: `loan_status`
- Features include:
  - Borrower information
  - Loan characteristics
  - Credit history

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Feature scaling
- Removing data leakage features

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Loan status distribution
- Correlation analysis
- Default behavior patterns across borrower segments

### 4️⃣ Modeling
Several machine learning models were evaluated, including:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

### 5️⃣ Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC

---

## 📈 Results
The final model achieved:
- Strong classification performance
- Balanced precision and recall
- Robust generalization on unseen data

This indicates the model is suitable for **risk assessment use cases** in financial lending.
